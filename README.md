## 👋 Hey there, I’m Debjit

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate developer and problem-solver who loves turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient, and creative code.

💻 Tech Stack:
I’m fluent in C++, JavaScript, and Python, and I’m especially focused on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack for full-stack development. I enjoy building scalable, dynamic web applications and exploring new tools that push the boundaries of what technology can do.

🚀 About Me:
I believe that learning never stops. Whether I’m debugging a stubborn issue or designing a new feature, I’m always striving to understand the “why” behind the code. I value collaboration, open-source culture, and the opportunity to build tools that make a difference.

🌟 Featured Project – “tRIAL-cLIENTS”
My biggest and proudest project so far is tRIAL-cLIENTS, a platform designed to help developers and freelancers land their first real projects. The idea is simple but powerful — to create a space where individuals can showcase their skills to the world, gain experience, and build confidence by working on practical tasks.

Through tRIAL-cLIENTS, I aim to bridge the gap between “learning” and “doing.” It’s more than just a project; it’s a community-driven initiative to empower beginners to take their first professional step in tech.

🌱 Why I’m Here:
I’m here to learn, share, and grow. GitHub is not just a place to host code — it’s where innovation thrives through collaboration. I want to connect with other developers, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep improving my craft with every commit.
